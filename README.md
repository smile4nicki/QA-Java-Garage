# QA-Java-Garage

Using Vehicle as a base class, create three derived classes (car, motorcycle etc.),
each derived class should have its own individual attribute in addition to the normal
Vehicle attributes that it inherits.

Using a List implementation store all your vehicles in a Garage class
Create a method in Garage that iterates through each Vehicle, calculating a bill for
each type of Vehicle in a different way, depending on the type of vehicle it is.
Garage should have methods that add Vehicle, remove Vehicle(s) (By ID, By Vehicle
Type) fix Vehicle (Calculate bill) and empty the garage.
